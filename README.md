🛍️ Retail Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

This project implements a K-Means Clustering algorithm to group retail store customers based on their purchase history.
It helps businesses understand customer behavior, identify high-value customers, and design targeted marketing strategies.

📂 Dataset
We use a customer dataset containing features like:

Customer ID

Annual income

Spending score

Purchase frequency

(You can use any CSV file with these columns, e.g., customers.csv.)

⚙ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy (data preprocessing)

Matplotlib, Seaborn (visualization)

Scikit-Learn (K-Means clustering and evaluation)

🚀 Project Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Load dataset

Select relevant features: annual income, spending score, purchase frequency

Handle missing values

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyze correlations between features

Visualize customer distribution and patterns

Model Training

Apply K-Means clustering

Determine the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method

Fit the model and assign customers to clusters

Visualization & Insights

Plot clusters for easy interpretation

Analyze characteristics of each customer segment

📊 Results

Identifies distinct customer groups based on purchase behavior

Helps businesses target high-value customers

Provides actionable insights for marketing strategies
